### Game Design
Be sure to explain every main scene in your game and all the moving parts. Describe all the sprites, their interactions, how they are born and die, and what causes the scene to change states (if it does.)

### Software Engineering Plan
Describe the structure of the team, each person's primary responsibilities, a proposed (and actual) time line with milestones identified, and any other documentation needed for process management.

### State Transition Diagram
Please show a simple state transition diagram describing the various states in your game and how the transitions between these states occur.

### User Instructions
Some user instructions can go into the game, but other parts of the instruction set (installation notes, language or platform requirements, etc) need to be available before the user runs the game.
